The focus of the Proof Of Concept will be to demonstrate the current advancements made to the Ampersand software that allow us to translate the Event - Condition - Action (ECA) rules to SQL statements which can be used be Ampersand to resolve any violations or inconsistencies in the Ampersand Database.
\newline\newline
\indent We will first give a brief introduction of the Ampersand software to team attending our Proof of concept demo. This will allow the team members of Team 2 to understand Ampersand and get an idea of what Ampersand is capable of producing (i.e. Information Systems). We will first compile a simple ADL script in Ampersand to generate a working
information system. At this point, once we have a working information system generated from Ampersand we we'll inform the audience about what other artifacts can be generated from the Ampersand software.

Once everyone in the audience is on board with Ampersand and its capabilities, we will go ahead and demonstrate our project. For this purpose, we'll use the same example that was used in the previous demonstration, which is a Project Administration Information System. The aim is to demonstrate the SQL that is generated from the ECA rules that Ampersand already generates. A manual translation of ECA to SQL will demonstrate the minimal correctness of the generated SQL. Once that is clear, the we'll inform the audience about what challenges lie ahead and what's the next milestone we will be working on.
