Project Description: In Ampersand, information systems are specified by modelling the state into concepts and relations with formal invariant rules explicitly included. Business transactions are specified using formalised process rules. The execution of process rules needs to preserve all invariants; for this purpose, the current Ampersand implementation derives a set of process-algebra-inspired ``Event-Condition-Action'' (ECA) rules. The main task for the current project is translation of these ECA rules into SQL (via an abstract syntax tree datatype for SQL in Haskell) for inclusion in the information system generated by the Ampersand backend. For inclusion in the production system, generating proofs of the correctness of the generated SQL is also required. Other applications of SQL generation to consider include use of the ECA rules to enhance the functionality of the generated front-ends.

Initial Goal: To create a parser in Haskell to generate SQL ASTs in accordance to ECA Rules

              // Normalization steps:
              //     -((-(cod~;lhsTerm~;rhsTerm;cod) /\ -(cod~;rhsTerm~;lhsTerm;cod)) \/ sub)
              // <=> { De Morgan }
              //     -(-(cod~;lhsTerm~;rhsTerm;cod) /\ -(cod~;rhsTerm~;lhsTerm;cod)) /\ -sub
              // <=> { De Morgan }
              //     (cod~;lhsTerm~;rhsTerm;cod \/ cod~;rhsTerm~;lhsTerm;cod) /\ -sub
              // <=> { distribute /\ over \/ }
              //     (cod~;lhsTerm~;rhsTerm;cod /\ -sub) \/ (cod~;rhsTerm~;lhsTerm;cod /\ -sub)
              // <=> { Avoid complements, using law x/\-y = x-y and Avoid complements, using law x/\-y = x-y }
              //     cod~;lhsTerm~;rhsTerm;cod - sub \/ cod~;rhsTerm~;lhsTerm;cod - sub
