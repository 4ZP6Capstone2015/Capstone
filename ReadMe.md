From Dr. Spencer: 
Hello Jaeden, Yash and Yuriy.

Given that your team’s project is different from the typical project, I recommend that we proceed as follows for your next deliverables:

1. Replace the Design Document due on January 11 with another Proof of Concept Demonstration.  Your team did not really have a full PoC, since you did not demonstrate any of your implementation.  The January PoC will be like what the other teams have been presenting over the last few weeks.  You should create a document describing what you will demonstrate in the January PoC and commit it to your repository.  You are essentially updating your current PoC plan to reflect what you will be doing for PoC number 2.  Dan, Dr. Kahl and I will use this document to compare against what you are demonstrating.  The date of the PoC may not be January 11; we will need to schedule a time for the presentation that works for everyone.

2. Your Design Document due date will move to the due date for Revision 0 demonstration (Feb 1 to Feb 12).

3. For the peer evaluation of the design document, you will be assigned another team’s document as usual.  Since you will not have a design document to share with another team, another team will be invited to your PoC.  They will be graded on the quality of the questions they ask and the comments they make.

For the calculation of your grades, the second PoC will be worth what the design document was originally worth (5%).  The grading of your design document will be rolled into the grading of the Revision 0 Demonstration (5%).  The emphasis for the grading will be on your Rev 0 demonstration, since the assumption is that a good demonstration implies a good design document.  :-)

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Best wishes.
