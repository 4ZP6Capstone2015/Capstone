%% YT: What is EFA? What is ECA? These should be defined before they are used;

%% Note: You don't need to put \indent before every paragraph. Latex inserts
%% that automatically. You can change the amount by changing the value of
%% \parindent.  Also instead of manually adding a line break after every
%% paragraph, just use parskip (see above).

The Ampersand Project translates the non-functional requirements of a
business into the functional specifications required by software engineers. It
also provides engineers with a variety of aids which help them to design
products that fulfill all of the needs of their clients and the end-users; for
example, by generating prototype software from the requirements.
%% such as data models and service catalogues.

Business requirements are not universal and often vary from one country or
culture to the next. Additional difficulty arises from the fact that business
requirements are not easily translatable into design requirements. 

The Ampersand Project has proven reliable at translating natural
language into technical specifications so that they could be incorporated into
the overall design. Business transactions input by the user are translated into
``process rules''; and requirements are translated into ``Event-Condition
Action'' (ECA) rules. Both of these rules are combined into a single SQL
program. Currently, a programmer using Ampersand must manually ensure that each
requirement is satisfied after each transaction, by telling Ampersand how each
violation must be fixed. Not only is this process error prone, it is
unmaintainable; when new requirements are added, the already-existing system may
violate the new restrictions. In many scenarios, the requirements may be safety
and security critical. To this end, Ampersand must also generate relational
algebra proofs to show that the SQL generated from ECA rules is sound. 

This project will focus primarily on modifying Ampersand to include the
translation from requirements to ECA rules to SQL commands (whereas the pipeline
for process rules is already in place). This will ameliorate Ampersand in two
ways; by automating part of the programmers job, namely writing code to preserve
requirements throughout a transaction; and by generating SQL code which is
proven to not violate any system requirements.
