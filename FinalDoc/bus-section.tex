{\section{The Purpose of the Project}\label{sec:Purpose}}

%% The Background of the Project Effort
%A large part of designing software systems is requirements engineering. One
%of the greatest challenges of requirements engineering is translating from
%business requirements to a functional specification. Business requirements are
%informal, with the intention of being easily understood by humans; however,
%functional specifications are written in formal language to unambiguously capture attributes of the 
%information system. Typically, this translation
%of business requirements to a formal specification is done by a requirements
%engineer, which can be prone to human error.
%
%Ampersand is a tool which aims to address this problem in a different way; by
%translating business requirements written in natural language into a formal
%specification by means of a ``compilation process'' \citep{derFun}. 
%Even though the business requirements and formal specification are written in
%entirely different languages, the ``compiler guarantees compliance between the
%two'' \citep[2]{derFun}. 
%
%Ampersand also provides engineers with a variety of aids which
%helps them to design products that fulfill all of the needs of their clients and
%the end-users; including data models, service catalogs and their
%specifications. Ampersand has proven reliable in practical situations, and there have been
%efforts to teach this approach to business analysts. 
%
% A large portion of the Ampersand system is already in place; the primary focus of this project was to
%augment Ampersand with increased capabilities for automation. The module ``Automatically Fix Violations'' in Figure ~\ref{fig:EFAproject} represents the EFA project and where it fits in the current version of Ampersand.
%
%Ampersand, before the EFA project included an algorithm to generate the
%post-conditions (i.e. formal specifications) of each function. It also contained the ECA rules that are generated by the Ampersand compiler. 
%However, these ECA rules were not being called in order to automatically restore violations.
% With the EFA extension for Ampersand, it allows us to automatically rehabilitate existing system data while 
%maintaining the information system according to user specifications. It also allows us to
%automatically restore system invariants and create a program that allows 
%Ampersand to make the most efficient choice regarding how it wishes proceed 
%based on each individual case.

Ampersand follows a \emph{rule based} design principle. Rules are integral to an organization
and these are based on some principles and guidelines set by the organization.
Ampersand uses an ECA ( Event - Condition - Action) approach to make sure all rules are satisfied. An ideal information infrastructure supports employees and other stakeholders to maintain the rules of the business. To maintain a rule means to prevent or correct all violations that might occur due to any external or internal factor.
 
 A large portion of the Ampersand system is already in place; the primary focus of this project was to
augment Ampersand with increased capabilities for automation. The module ``Automatically Fix Violations'' in Figure ~\ref{fig:EFAproject} represents the EFA project and where it fits in the current version of Ampersand.
This problem is addressed in Ampersand using AMMBR \citep{Ampersand}. The role of the AMMBR method in Ampersand automatically generate correction methods that help maintain these business rules. In AMMBR, human involvement is only limited to representing rules (in the ADL files). While the Ampersand software still remains in development phase, there is no way of checking the correctness of the AMMBR method at a low level. Previously, the Exec Engine was used to maintain these business rules, that required direct injection of SQL hand-written as PHP strings. 
 
With the extension of Ampersand by the EFA project, we allow means of checking the correctness of the Action associated with an ECA rule. This will allow us to automatically rehabilitate existing system data while 
maintaining the information system according to user specifications. 
Furthermore, EFA allows us to
automatically restore system invariants and create a program that allows 
Ampersand to make the most efficient choice regarding how it 
wishes\edinsert{JG:to} proceed 
based on each individual case. The ECA rules, which act as an input to the EFA project are translated to human-readable SQL. This can later be viewed in the command line using the \verb|``~-~-print~-eca~-info''| flag written out in one of the artifacts. The generated SQL, not only allows for checking the correctness of AMMBR but also helps in identifying 
patterns and unreachable states of the method. EFA project will also be utilized to complete the AMMBR algorithm and also to test out future modification to the AMMBR algorithm.  Since AMMBR is an essential element of the Ampersand software, EFA will complement modifications to this method.

 \section{The Stakeholders and the intended audience}\label{sec:Stakeholders}
The stake holders of Ampersand are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Ampersand Designers}: Responsible for maintaining and developing Ampersand.
	\item \textbf{The Customer}: The end users of Ampersand will benefit from the EFA project. This will decreases the amount of time 
Ampersand users spend manually inserting PHP code to restore system invariants. 
\end{itemize}

This document is designed to help introduce new Ampersand users to EFA 
(ECA rules for Ampersand). It provides a basic structure that allows 
individuals to quickly access the information they seek.

\edcomm{JG:}{The implementation environment is covered in design.}
% \section{Implementation Environment}
%Our implementation environment depends on the core Ampersand. No extra 
%dependencies have been added to the Ampersand. The external libraries that 
%were 
%added to Ampersand under the EFA project have been documented in the external 
%libraries section under System Architecture and Module Hierarchy.
