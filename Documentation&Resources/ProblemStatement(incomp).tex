\indent Ampersand provides users with an efficient tool to integrate 
non-functional aspects of requirement engineering into a useable framework for 
the development of software. It does this by providing users with the 
ability to derive functional requirements from cultural and legal 
regulations. There are important non-functional requirements that are necessary 
for the ( logistics ) of any business and is fundamental to its success. \\
