Hello teammates,

I will repeat this point MANY times so that it is not missed. DO NOT insert changes to the Problem Statement once I upload it, 
if you want something added or changed please TRACK your changes and save it into another copy or email me about the changes you 
want/need/think should be made or upload a different version with the name ProblemStatement_editedby<insertname>. 

If I ever upload anything that has (incomp) in the title, feel free to add changes directly to it. BUT DO NOT DO IT TO THE EDITED VERSION!
If a file has <title> without (incomp) it means it IS the edited version.

E.g., ProblemStatement(incomp).tex 
-- feel free to make changes and replace the file with the one you've made changes to

E.g., ProblemStatement.tex
-- DO NOT SAVE OVER THIS FILE WITH YOUR CHANGES

PLEASE DO NOT MAKE CHANGES DIRECTLY ON THE VERSION THAT IS UPLOADED!

Thank you,
J
