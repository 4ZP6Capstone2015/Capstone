\chapter{General Information}

%1.1 Purpose/Summary
\section{Purpose} 
This document outlines the test plan for ECA for Ampersand, including our
general approach to testing, system test cases, and a specification of
methodology and constraints. This test plan specifically targets our
contribution to Ampersand, namely ECA -- elements of Ampersand, such as design
artifact generation, will not be tested. 

%% %1.3 Objectives
\section{Objectives}
\subsubsection*{Preparation for testing}
The primary objective of this test plan is to collect all relevant information
in preperation of the actual testing process, in order to facilitate this process.

\subsubsection*{Communication}
This test plan intends to clearly communicate to all developers of ECA for Ampersand 
their intended role in the testing process. 

\subsubsection*{Motivation}
The testing approach is motivated by constraints and requirements outlined in the
Software Requirements Specification. This document seeks to clearly demonstrate
this motivation.

\subsubsection*{Environment}
This test plans outlines the resources, tools, and software required for the
testing process. This includes any resources needed to perform automated testing. 

\subsubsection*{Scope}
This test plan intends to better describe the scope of our contribution, ECA,
within Ampersand.

\section{Software Description}
Ampersand is a software tool which converts a formal specification of business
entities and rules, and compiles it into different design artifacts, as well as
a prototype web application.

This prototype implements the business logic in the original specification, in
the form of a relational database with a simple web-app front-end.

A particular class of relational database violations can be automatically
restored; the algorithm for computing the code to fix these violations is called
AMMBR \cite{amber}.  This class of violations is realized within Ampersand as
ECA rules -- our contribution to Ampersand will add support for ECA rules, in
both the Ampersand back-end and the generated prototype.

\section{Test Team}

\section{Requirements}
\subsection{Functional requirements}
The functional requirements for ECA for Ampersand are detailed in the SRS; they
are also briefly summarized here. Our implementation must

\begin{description}
\item[F1] provably implement the desired algorithm.
\item[F2] accept its input in the existing ADL file format.
\item[F3] produce an output compatible with the existing pipeline. 
\item[F4] be a pure function; it should not have side effects.  
\item[F5] not introduce appreciable performance degredation. 
\item[F6] provide diagnostic information about the algorithm to
the user, if the user asks for such information.
\end{description}

\subsection{Non-Functional requirements}
The functional requirements for ECA for Ampersand are detailed in the SRS; they
are also briefly summarized here. Our implementation must

\begin{description}
\item[N1] produce output which will be easily understood by the typical user,
  such as a requirements engineer, and will not be misleading or confusing.  
\item[N2] be composed of easily maintainable, well documented code.
\item[N3] compile and run in the environment currently used to develop
  Ampersand.
\item[N4] annotated generated code with proofs of correctness or derivations,
  where appropriate. 
\item[N5] automatically fix database violations in the mock database of the
  prototype.
